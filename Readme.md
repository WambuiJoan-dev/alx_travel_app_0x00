Database Modeling and Data Seeding in Django
Project: alx_travel_app_0x00
This project focuses on establishing the essential backend components of a travel booking application using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF). The core objective is to define the relational database structure, enable API data representation through serializers, and implement a robust database seeding mechanism for development and testing.

üöÄ Key Concepts and Learning Outcomes
This task covers the following fundamental Django development principles:

Django Models: Defining Python classes that map to the application's database tables (Listing, Booking, Review).

Relational Data: Implementing One-to-Many relationships using ForeignKey to link bookings and reviews to specific listings.

Serializers (DRF): Creating serializers to transform complex Django model data into JSON format suitable for API endpoints.

Management Commands: Extending Django's command-line interface (CLI) with a custom seed command to automate database population.

Database Seeding: Programmatically inserting realistic sample data to streamline development and provide a consistent testing environment.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone <your-repo-url> alx_travel_app_0x00
cd alx_travel_app_0x00
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

Bash

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies:
You must have Django and Django REST Framework installed.

Bash

pip install django djangorestframework
Apply Migrations:
Generate and apply the database schema based on the defined models in listings/models.py.

Bash

python manage.py makemigrations listings
python manage.py migrate
üíª Task Implementation Summary
1. Model Definitions (listings/models.py)
Three core models were defined with necessary fields, constraints, and relationships:

Listing: Represents the bookable property (e.g., title, price_per_night, city).

Booking: Holds reservation details, linked to Listing via ForeignKey.

Review: Stores user feedback, linked to Listing via ForeignKey, including a rating field.

2. Serializers (listings/serializers.py)
Django REST Framework serializers were created for data representation:

ReviewSerializer: Basic serializer for review data.

BookingSerializer: Prepares booking data, including a listing_title field sourced from the related Listing object.

ListingSerializer: The main serializer, which nests the ReviewSerializer to include all related reviews in a single API response.

3. Database Seeding (listings/management/commands/seed.py)
A custom management command named seed was implemented to populate the database with sample data:

It extends django.core.management.base.BaseCommand.

It utilizes the @transaction.atomic decorator to ensure the entire seeding process is treated as a single, all-or-nothing database transaction.

It uses bulk_create for efficient insertion of large numbers of Booking and Review records.

It includes a cleanup phase to delete existing data before seeding, ensuring a fresh start.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution and Testing
Running the Seeder
To populate the database with sample data, run the custom management command:

Bash

# Seeds the database with 10 sample listings (and their associated bookings/reviews)
python manage.py seed
